==========
CSV Loader
==========

This example loads Assets, Parties, Books and Transactions from csv files into AMaaS.

Note that for convenience, the example also creates the csv files in the first place from
generated dummy data.  Obviously in reality this data would not be generated from AMaaS,
but rather uploaded from an external source.
