==============================
Market Data from Yahoo Finance
==============================

This example sets up a handful of equities using real stock tickers.  It then connects to Yahoo Finance and pulls 
back the EOD price for each of the stocks.  These prices are then persisted to AMaaS.

Pre-Requisites
--------------

You need to install the Yahoo Finance library "yahoo-finance" first.  This is available using pip.

More information on this library is available from https://github.com/lukaszbanasiak/yahoo-finance.
